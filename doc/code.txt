I make this document for you guys to write more in details what changes you have made. I think it would be useful to see what needs to be done next.

Ex:

- I add a new class Blah with damage(), defend()...
- I modified method Blah so that it now accepts an int instead of a string...

I'm not sure what you guys had discussed on Wednesday, so I decide to have some elements as followed to make
the game more simple:
- Glass: water ability, can kill red enemies (fire), vulnerable to blue enemies (electricity)
- Orange: ducky ability, can kill blue enemy (electricity), vulnerable to purple enemies (sharpy)
- White: eraser ability, can kill enemies instantly
- Gray: clay ability, can kill purple enemies (sharpy), vulnerable to red enemies (fire)
- Dice: multiple colors, give random damages, receive random damages

Character can shoot bullets that also have the character's element
Character changes color when picking an object
Battles with different enemies have different damages.
Touching enemies also damages the enemies or makes yourself get hit by them, depending on your/their elements
The only obstacle is lava
